# SpringRestRouter

**Stubbornly using Spring Boot to route my personal website that I'm serving on a raspberry pi**

Overall Plan
============

The whole idea is to use Spring to route my static pages and avoid having stuff like ".html" in my url's.
So, TL/DR: it's about routing *Ã  la* NextJs and before you ask, no I never actually used that framework,
but I've heard some people comment on what it's used for so I thought I'd give a try with Spring.
