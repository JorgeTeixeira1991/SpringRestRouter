## ABOUT ME

I'm a wannabe musician turned developer :) 

My love for all things logic has always kind of dictated my path in life, that's the reason I love music so much, and clearly why I've always been in love with electronics and electricity in general.

I recently completed a 3-month bootcamp to reconvert my skillset into web development, drawing from my prior experience in high school studying electronics and programming in C.

My latest pet project involves using python to scrape data from a known collectibles marketplace and store it in a database so I can have access to price action history.

Currently I'm working as a Systems Analyst for the Integration Department at Retail Consult, a company that specializes in implementing and customizing Oracle Retail Solutions.
